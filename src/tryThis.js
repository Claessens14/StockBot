I am here to assist with navigating the stock market, I can provide information on stocks that are on the S&P500, such as financials, statistics and more! Also can provide market updates on the major indices. Furthermore, if you have education question, I can do my best to that answer that also. Type "examples" for suggested actions.


Here are some examples questions.. "what do the earnings look like for chevron?" or "what is the NASDAQ at?" or "what's a bear market?"
